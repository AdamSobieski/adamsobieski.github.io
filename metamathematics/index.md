## Introduction

This is a sketchpad for some [metalogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalogic) and [metamathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamathematics) ideas.

Mathematical expressions can be considered as naturally being nested trees of n-ary functions, these capable of being mapped with arbitrary mathematical notations.

$$ equals(plus(2, 2), 4) \Leftrightarrow 2 + 2 = 4 $$

Let us consider a function, $C$,

$$ < S_{N+1}, R_{N+1}^{+}, R_{N+1}^{-}, M_{N+1}^{+}, M_{N+1}^{-} > = C ( S_{N}, R_{N}^{+}, R_{N}^{-}, M_{N}^{+}, M_{N}^{-} ) $$
