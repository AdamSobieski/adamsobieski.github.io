## Introduction

This is a sketchpad for some [metalogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalogic) and [metamathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamathematics) ideas.

Mathematical expressions can be considered as naturally being nested trees of n-ary functions, these capable of being mapped with arbitrary mathematical notations.

$$ equals(plus(2, 2), 4) \Leftrightarrow 2 + 2 = 4 $$

Let us consider a function, $C$,

$$ \langle S_{N+1}, R^{+}_{N+1}, R^{-}_{N+1}, M^{+}_{N+1}, M^{-}_{N+1} \rangle = C(S_{N}, R^{+}_{N}, R^{-}_{N}, M^{+}_{N}, M^{-}_{N}) $$
