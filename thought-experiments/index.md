## Introduction

This is a sketchpad for some [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment).

## Higher-dimensional Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence

What if artificial-intelligence systems could perceive, navigate, and explore higher-dimensional simulated environments?

How would artificial, simulated higher-dimensional sensors work? For four-dimensional spaces, might artificial retinas be three-dimensional? Would four-dimensional lenses focus incoming rays onto three-dimensional retinas?

Would artificial neural networks be able to readily learn to control attached sensors and to move around in four-dimensional spaces, perceiving and comprehending these environments?

Would artificial-intelligence systems trained in higher-dimensional spaces be able to directly imagine higher-dimensional phenomena?
