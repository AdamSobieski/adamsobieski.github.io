## Introduction

This is a sketchpad for some [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment).

## Computer-automated Scientific Discovery

What if artificial-intelligence systems, e.g., [intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent) or [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system), could produce and present us with useful [scientific models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling) from observations and data? Might such systems be able to [seek observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)), ask questions, or, better, design scientific experiments? How might those best models provided by these systems change – how might [paradigm shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) happen – as more observations were provided to them or as more processing or more reasoning occurred?

## Exotic Sensory Modalities

Artificial-intelligence systems can [attend to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossmodal_attention), [perceive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception), and [integrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisensory_integration) data from kinds of sensors beyond those corresponding with the human [visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system), [auditory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system), [vestibular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system), [olfactory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_system), [gustatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustatory_system), and [somatosensory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system) sensory systems.

Examples of other, [nonhuman animal sensory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense#Nonhuman_animal_sensation_and_perception) include [electroreception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroreception), [magnetoreception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoreception), [echolocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation), [hygroreception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygroreception), and [infrared sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes).

Kinds of [sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor) include [automotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Automotive), [acoustic, sound, and vibration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Acoustic,_sound,_vibration), [chemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Chemical), [electric current, electric potential, magnetic, and radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Electric_current,_electric_potential,_magnetic,_radio), [environment, weather, moisture, and humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Environment,_weather,_moisture,_humidity), [flow, fluid, and velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Flow,_fluid_velocity), [ionizing radiation and subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Ionizing_radiation,_subatomic_particles), [navigation instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Navigation_instruments), [position, angle, displacement, distance, speed, and acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Position,_angle,_displacement,_distance,_speed,_acceleration), [optical, light, imaging, and photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Optical,_light,_imaging,_photon), [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Pressure), [force, density, and level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Force,_density,_level), [thermal, heat, and temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Thermal,_heat,_temperature), [proximity and presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Proximity,_presence), [sensor technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Sensor_technology), [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Speed_sensor), and [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sensors#Others).

## Higher-dimensional Sensory Modalities

How might sensors work for higher-dimensional spaces? For [four-dimensional spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space), might four-dimensional [lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens) [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)) incoming rays onto three-dimensional [retinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina)?

Can artificial-intelligence systems, e.g., artificial neural networks, learn to control such attached sensors and to perceive, comprehend, navigate, and explore [simulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation) higher-dimensional environments?

## Comparative Physics

Using [computer simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation), scientists could create and vary models and systems other than those describing our universe.

The [Universe Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniverseMachine) is a project carrying out astrophysical supercomputer simulations of various models of possible universes. The project was created by astronomer Peter Behroozi and his research team at the Steward Observatory and the University of Arizona.

Numerous universes with different physical characteristics may be simulated in order to develop insights into the possible beginning and evolution of our universe. Behroozi indicates that, "on the computer, we can create many different universes and compare them to the actual one, and that lets us infer which rules lead to the one we see."
