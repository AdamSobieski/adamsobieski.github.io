## Introduction

This is a sketchpad for some [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment).

## Higher-dimensional Computer Vision

What if artificial-intelligence systems could perceive, navigate, and explore simulated higher-dimensional environments?

How would sensors work for higher-dimensional spaces? For four-dimensional spaces, would four-dimensional lenses focus incoming rays onto three-dimensional retinas?

Can artificial neural networks learn to control attached sensors and move around in higher-dimensional spaces, perceiving and comprehending these environments?

Would artificial-intelligence systems trained in higher-dimensional spaces be able to directly imagine higher-dimensional phenomena?
